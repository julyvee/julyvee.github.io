Retrospectives are an essential part of the agile development process. They provide teams with a valuable opportunity to reflect on their progress, identify areas for improvement, and make adjustments to their approach. However, too often these retrospectives can feel like a box-ticking exercise, rather than a meaningful process that drives real change. But what is a meaningful retrospective? A meaningful retrospective outputs effective action items that will actually be implemented and enable everyone in the team to do their best work. This blog post presents some theory and tips to make your retros more meaningful. Follow these to make sure your retrospective doesn't turn into a regrettospective!

## Culture Prerequisites

To conduct successful retrospectives, certain cultural prerequisites must be present within the team. Most of them have a lot of synergies with each other so establishing one will help you establishing the others more easily. They also go hand in hand with the reasoning behind the different retro agenda items (see "Retro Agenda" section below). In the end, the goal is always the same: To conduct a retro that is worth the time and effort that goes into it. To achieve this, these five key prerequisites should be established.

### Prime Directive

> *“We must believe that everyone did the best job they could, given the information known at the time, their skills and situation and resources available.”*

The prime directive is the foundational prerequisite for a successful agile retrospective. Believing in this directive means that the team understands that everyone has different skills, knowledge, and resources, and that no one is perfect. The team should focus on identifying causes and circumstances that led to mistakes, rather than blaming individuals. This leads to a trust culture where people feel free to share their opinions openly and transparently remove blockers to progress.

### Psychological Safety

Adding on to the prime directive in a more general sense, psychological safety refers to a team culture where team members feel free to share positive and negative feedback without fear of retribution for mistakes or criticism. This creates a safe space where everyone is encouraged to express their thoughts, which ultimately leads to more creative and innovative solutions. Teams should recognize that it is okay to fail, because it provides an opportunity for learning. If psychological safety is not established, people will not share their real opinions or mistakes, so no significant improvement can be made. The retrospective would become a meaningless chore.

### Open to Discussing Causes

Teams should avoid jumping to solutions immediately and instead take the time to deep dive and understand the root causes of problems. By taking a systematic approach and spending enough time to generate insights, teams can identify the underlying issues that are contributing to a problem. This helps the team to create action items that address the root cause of the problem instead of just the symptoms, which often leads to a more effective and sustainable solution. Of course, this can only be achieved if the teams takes sufficient time to conduct the retro. When the timeline is too tight, it is more likely that cause discussion will be skipped.

### Optimism

The team has to believe in the retro and its ability to drive continuous improvement and learning. People who believe in the purpose of the retro are going to participate more actively, which creates more opportunities to improve. Also, teams should not forget to talk about the positives and recognize the good work that has been done. Many retros often only take the time to talk about negative aspects and how to improve and while that is important, it can also become frustrating and create a negative atmosphere. Taking time to talk about the positives and how to leverage the teams strenghts creates an environment that fosters optimism and a desire for progress, making your retro more fun as well as improving the outcome.

### Dedication

The team must be dedicated to the retrospective process. Teams should take sufficient time to conduct the retrospective and actively participate in the process in order to make the most out of every agenda item (see section below). Additionally, team members should be dedicated to implementing the action items that are identified during the retrospective. Explaning the reasoning behind the different agenda items and addressing the other culture prerequisites can drastically improve dedication. Finally, teams should revisit past action items periodically to remind themselves of their commitment and see the progress that has already been made. Explicitly stating what has been improved by past retrospectives is motivating and makes the retrospective more meaningful, instead of it feeling like an obligatory ceremony to get through.

## Retro Agenda

The success of a retrospective largely depends on how it is conducted. The typical retrospective agenda consists of five key items: set the stage, gather data, generate insights, decide what to do, and close the retro. In this blog post, we will explore the reasoning behind each agenda item, why it is important, and the potential consequences of skipping it.

### Set the Stage

The first item on the agenda is setting the stage. This involves an icebreaker or reflection exercise, reviewing past action items, presenting the retro format and theme, and setting the time frame and agenda. The ice breaker question is usually positive and non-controversial (e.g. "What was your favorite lunch this week?"), which makes it easier for everyone to participate. This creates an optimistic mood for the retrospective. By including everyone from the beginning, it becomes more likely that they will share later. Additionally, the facilitator can use this item to align the retro with the team's goals. In an online retrospective, this is a good moment to encourage people to turn on the camera so they will feel more connected.

Skipping this item can cause the retro to fail. When team members are not given the opportunity to warm up and connect, they may not feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions later on. It is also essential to establish a clear agenda and time frame to ensure that the retro remains focused and productive.

### Gather Data

In "Gather Data", the team talks about what happened in the sprint, whether good or bad, and gathers as many data items as possible. It is important to talk about experiences during the sprint in a factual way, by saying "This made me feel..." or "This happened". Resist the temptation to already suggest solutions at this stage! This way every experience and feeling is valid, which creates a sharing atmosphere where everyone's voice is heard. This is the agenda item people usually see as the core of the retrospective. While it is actually just the basis for generating insights, it is still crucial. Without a basis for the retro, there is nothing to reflect on or improve. Gathering lots of data allows the team to identify areas for improvement and work towards addressing them.

### Generate Insights

The real star of the retrospective is generating insights, which means going into cause analysis and deep discussion about a few items. This agenda item is important to understand how systems and processes affect the team and which areas the team has control over, in order to create effective actions. The facilitator should keep the discussion focused on causes, not solutions (yet), and take sufficient time to get everyone's perspective. Also remember to discuss the root causes of positive data items in order to further leverage the team's strengths.

Skipping this item can cause the retro to become unproductive. Without a deep understanding of the causes of issues, the team may end up focusing on symptoms rather than root causes. This can lead to ineffective action items, frustration and the feeling that nothing is improving (see "Wheel of Fortune" antipattern below).

### Decide What to Do

Now the time for solutions has finally come! In this step, the team suggests action items to address the causes identified in "Generate Insights", focusing on things the team can control. Pick 1-3 action items to implement in the next sprint. Even if more good action items have been suggested, avoid overwhelming the team with too many actions or they might not get implemented. Effective actions enable the team to do their best, remove blockers and create positive feelings of improvement.

The facilitator should keep track of action items for future reference to ensure that they are implemented. This way, the team can also see their progress which can be a great motivation.

### Closing the Retro

The final item on the agenda is closing the retro. This is often skipped to save time, but it has a lot of benefits. The facilitator can link the action items identified in the previous step back to data and insights, increasing motivation for the team to implement them. To make implementation even more likely, state who is responsible for implementing which action, get explicit commitment for the team and mention when action items will be re-evaluated. A closing activity can also provide feedback to facilitator and help improve the retro.

Skipping this item can lead to a lack of motivation to implement action items or improve in the future, so consider taking the time to close the retro properly.

### Time

Now that you know the reasoning behind every agenda item and why it shouldn't be skipped, it is clear that the team must allocate a sufficient amount of time to conduct the retro. Cutting discussions too short or skipping agenda items can lead to ineffective retros, while investing just a bit more time can improve the outcome drastically. When scheduling the retro, keep the size of the team and the length of the sprint in mind. Of course, you won't be able to discuss all data items but there should be enough time to do a cause analysis of the most important ones and to have everyone share their thoughts. If you feel like your team's retros are ineffective, few team members get the chance to participate in discussions or you find yourself frequently skipping agenda items, definitely consider making the next retro longer to get the most benefit out of every agenda item. If on the other hand you're going through all agenda items in record time due to lack of active participation, check your culture prerequisites and try to find out why people don't want to share their perspectives.
