My name is Julia Valder. I'm a software engineer at Microsoft in the Industry Solutions Engineering Organization. This is my personal developer blog where I share software development learnings, methods and technologies from my projects.

The journey that led me to Microsoft includes many stops. If I think back far enough, I suppose you can thank a quiz app and my watch for my being here, but that's a long story. Places I've lived include Germany, the UK, the US, and Switzerland. I've been based in Zurich since 2018 and before joining ISE, I was part of a small local IT consulting company. I was initially nervous about moving to large company, but I knew this was an exciting opportunity that I just had to take. And everything I have encountered so far, the people, the technology, the culture, has made me incredibly happy and I can't wait to experience even more with ISE.
 
In my free time I like to take advantage of Switzerland's mountains with rock climbing, snowboarding, and hiking. Some of my indoor hobbies are kickboxing, playing the piano and video games. My guilty pleasure is collecting fountain pens and inks so if you ever wanted to learn lots of unnecessary facts about pens, I've got you.
 
When I'm working from home and you see me in a virtual meeting, you'll probably have the pleasure of meeting my two cats because they just love walking right in front of my camera.
 
I'm really looking forward to sharing my insights with you on this blog, and if you would like to contact me, let's connect on [LinkedIn]({{ site.linkedin }}).
